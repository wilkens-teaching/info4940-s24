# Interest areas
## Working session instructions
Your task is to introduce yourself to the other students in the class and to begin to feel out who would be your best collaborators.

In groups of 4-5 students (randomizing every 15 minutes or so):

* **Introduce yourself**: name, year in school, major, etc.
* **Describe your experience** in NLP, data science, programming, and humanities disciplines. This can include coursework, previous research opportunities, work experience or internships, clubs, hobbies, and anything else you deem relevant.
* Drawing on the reflection you wrote for today, describe the **areas of special interest** to you. You may be as specific as you like. If you have diverging interests, that's fine - try to cover them all!
* Summarize what you perceive to be your **strengths and weaknesses** in your prepration for the research tasks ahead.  
* Feel free to **ask questions** of others as they are presenting.
* **Take notes** as others are talking. You'll use these later to help you sort out potential collaborators.

The TAs and I will drop in to each group to facilitate discussion and to take some notes on interests and strengths.
